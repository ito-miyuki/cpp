# âœ¨C++ Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of small C++ projects and exercises organized by modules (cpp00 to cpp09). Each module focuses on a specific concept or set of concepts in modern C++.

## Structure and Learning Focus

- **cpp00**: Basic C++ syntax and structure
- **cpp01**: Data types and variable initialization
- **cpp02**: Control structures (conditionals and loops)
- **cpp03**: Functions and their usage
- **cpp04**: Arrays and string manipulation
- **cpp05**: Exception handling and class methods
- **cpp06**: Class definition and static methods
- **cpp07**: Core object-oriented programming concepts
- **cpp08**: Working with the Standard Template Library (STL)
